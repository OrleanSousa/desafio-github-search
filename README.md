
GitHub App
===================================

This project is my solution code for the "github-search" challenge, provided 
by [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me) - An Information Technology teaching platform.

App Overview
-------------

The project searches a given GitHub user and lists all of his public repositories, and from that 
point, we can open or share any item. The App also ensures that the username can be saved, read and 
overwritten.

You can check out [the original repository](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/desafio-github-search) for 
further reference.
